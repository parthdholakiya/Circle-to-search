# Circle to Search - Circle it, find it

Circle to Search is a project that simplifies the search process by leveraging the power of computer vision. With Circle to Search, you can simply circle an object in an image and quickly find relevant information about it online.

## How it Works

Using Python and libraries like PyTorch, YOLOv5, and googlesearch, Circle to Search detects objects in an image and performs a Google search based on the detected objects. This allows for a seamless search experience, especially in visually driven tasks.

## Features

- **Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv5 to detect objects in an image with high accuracy.
- **Google Search Integration:** Performs a Google search based on the detected objects, providing users with relevant information.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Simplifies the search process, making it more user-friendly and efficient.

## Installation

1. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision
   pip install yolov5
   pip install googleimport torch

## Future Improvements

-Implement a more user-friendly interface.

-Enhance the object detection algorithm for better accuracy.

-Expand search capabilities to other search engines and platforms.
